Where have I been.

Startup
-------

Clone the repository, having installed *node* with *npm*, *grunt-cli* and *bower*.
Next run *npm install* and *bower install* to install required *grunt* tasks and javascript assets.
You'll want to run *grunt watch* command to compile every .coffee and .less file inside the project.
